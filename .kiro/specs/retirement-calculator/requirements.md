# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A simple retirement calculator web application that helps users plan for retirement by calculating projected savings and retirement income. The application will be hosted on Cloudflare Pages as a static site, using only client-side browser storage for data persistence. Users can import and export their data for backup and portability. The calculator is designed with a modular structure to support future feature expansions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user planning for retirement, I want to input my current financial information and retirement goals, so that I can see projected retirement savings and income.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display input fields for current age, retirement age, current savings, monthly contribution, and expected annual return
2. WHEN a user enters valid financial data THEN the system SHALL calculate and display projected retirement savings
3. WHEN a user enters valid financial data THEN the system SHALL calculate and display projected monthly retirement income
4. IF any required field is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation messages
5. WHEN calculation parameters change THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate results in real-time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be saved automatically in my browser, so that I don't lose my information when I close and reopen the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters data THEN the system SHALL automatically save the data to browser local storage
2. WHEN a user reopens the application THEN the system SHALL restore previously saved data from local storage
3. WHEN local storage is not available THEN the system SHALL display a warning message and continue to function without persistence
4. WHEN data is saved THEN the system SHALL include a timestamp for the last update

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my retirement data to a file, so that I can back up my information or transfer it to another device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the export button THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable JSON file containing all user data
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as export date and application version
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL use a descriptive filename with timestamp
4. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message to the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import my retirement data from a previously exported file, so that I can restore my information or transfer it from another device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an import file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and structure
2. WHEN importing valid data THEN the system SHALL replace current data with imported data and update the display
3. WHEN importing valid data THEN the system SHALL save the imported data to local storage
4. IF the import file is invalid or corrupted THEN the system SHALL display an error message and preserve existing data
5. WHEN import is successful THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the calculation logic to be modular and extensible, so that I can easily add new retirement planning features in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing calculations THEN the system SHALL use separate modules for different calculation types
2. WHEN implementing the architecture THEN the system SHALL separate data models from calculation logic
3. WHEN implementing the architecture THEN the system SHALL use interfaces or contracts that allow for future extensions
4. WHEN adding new calculation features THEN the system SHALL not require changes to existing calculation modules

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work reliably in my web browser without requiring server connectivity, so that I can use it anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL function entirely in the client browser without server requests
2. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally for all core features
3. WHEN deployed to Cloudflare Pages THEN the system SHALL serve as a static site with no backend dependencies
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL be compatible with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
