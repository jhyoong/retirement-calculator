# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A simple web application for retirement planning calculations that helps users manage and analyze their financial data including income, expenses, investments, loans, and retirement goals. The application operates entirely in-memory with JSON import/export functionality for data persistence, providing flexible data input with customizable subcategories and real-time monthly-scale calculations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user planning for retirement, I want to input my financial data in flexible categories, so that I can customize the level of detail based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the user wants to add subcategories to any main category THEN the system SHALL allow dynamic addition of subcategory fields
3. WHEN the user wants to remove subcategories THEN the system SHALL allow deletion of subcategory fields without affecting other data
4. IF the user leaves subcategory fields empty THEN the system SHALL ignore them in calculations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and load my financial data using JSON files, so that I can preserve my work between sessions without requiring a database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks export THEN the system SHALL generate a JSON file containing all entered financial data and configuration
2. WHEN the user imports a JSON file THEN the system SHALL load all data and restore the previous session state
3. WHEN the user imports an invalid JSON file THEN the system SHALL display an error message and not modify existing data
4. WHEN the system exports data THEN the JSON SHALL contain all necessary information to recreate calculations and display states

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time calculations of my retirement projections, so that I can immediately understand the impact of my financial decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters or modifies any financial data THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate all projections
2. WHEN calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL use monthly time scales for all computations
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show projected retirement timeline, required savings, and monthly surplus/deficit
4. IF calculation inputs are incomplete THEN the system SHALL display partial results where possible and indicate missing data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input comprehensive financial data with time-based scheduling, so that I can create realistic retirement projections that account for changes over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses income fields THEN the system SHALL provide inputs for salary, bonuses, investment returns, and other income sources
2. WHEN the user accesses expense fields THEN the system SHALL provide inputs for housing, utilities, food, transportation, healthcare, and discretionary spending
3. WHEN the user accesses investment fields THEN the system SHALL provide inputs for current savings, monthly contributions, and expected returns
4. WHEN the user accesses economic factors THEN the system SHALL provide inputs for inflation rate, tax rates, and interest rates
5. WHEN the user accesses retirement goals THEN the system SHALL provide inputs for target retirement age, desired monthly income, and retirement duration
6. WHEN the user enters any financial data item THEN the system SHALL allow specification of start date, end date, and duration for that item
7. WHEN the user specifies time periods THEN the system SHALL accept month-year precision for scheduling (e.g., "April 2025")
8. WHEN the user plans recurring items THEN the system SHALL allow specification of duration in years and months (e.g., "10 years", "5 years starting April 2025")
9. IF the user doesn't specify time periods THEN the system SHALL assume the item applies from the current date indefinitely

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive web interface that works entirely in the browser, so that I can access my retirement planning tool without installing software or requiring internet connectivity for calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL load completely in the browser without external dependencies
2. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
3. WHEN the user navigates between sections THEN the system SHALL maintain data state without page refreshes
4. WHEN calculations are running THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to indicate processing status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see detailed breakdowns of my financial projections, so that I can understand how different factors contribute to my retirement timeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculations are complete THEN the system SHALL display monthly cash flow projections
2. WHEN displaying projections THEN the system SHALL show the impact of inflation on expenses over time
3. WHEN showing investment growth THEN the system SHALL display compound interest effects on savings
4. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL provide charts or graphs for visual representation of financial trends
